1:-What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

2:-React Components?

Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

Class Component
A class component must include the extends React.
Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

Function Component
A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand.

3:-React Props?

props stands for properties.
Props are arguments passed into React components.
Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

4:-React Events

Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

Adding Events
React events are written in camelCase syntax:
onClick instead of onclick.

5:-React Forms

Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page.

6:-React Hooks

Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. 
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

7:-React useState Hook

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

8:-React useEffect Hooks

The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

9:React Lifecycle
Lifecycle of Components
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting:-
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

Updating:-
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting:-
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.
React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

componentWillUnmount()

10.How React Works?

So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser's DOM.
